### Create PostgreSQL Database

Create a postgresql database with name of `e_commerce`. why `e_commerce`? A: it must be same name as in your `settings.py > DATABASES > default > NAME`

Once you have created the database now you need to install an PostgreSQL extension named `pg_trgm`. why need to install this extension? A: it help us to improve search functionality and performance.

To install `pg_trgm` extension first connect to `e_commerce` database. to do that run this command on `psql`

```bash
\c e_commerce
```

Once connected to the `e_commerce` database install the `pg_trgm` extension by running following command on `psql`

```bash
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
```
