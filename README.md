## ðŸš€ Installation & Setup

### Install PostgreSQL if not installed

On `Linux` use APT to install PostgreSQL

```bash
apt install postgresql
```

On `Windows` download PostgreSQL and install it.

### Create PostgreSQL Database

Create a postgresql database with name of `e_commerce`. why `e_commerce`? A: it must be same name as in your `settings.py > DATABASES > default > NAME`

Once you have created the database now you need to install an PostgreSQL extension named `pg_trgm`. why need to install this extension? A: it help us to improve search functionality and performance.

To install `pg_trgm` extension first connect to `e_commerce` database. to do that run this command on `psql`

```psql
\c e_commerce
```

Once connected to the `e_commerce` database install the `pg_trgm` extension by running following command on `psql`

```psql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shopon-Hossen/ecommerce-api-drf.git e_commerce
cd e_commerce
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```
This will create a isolated virtual environment in `.venv` directory.

if you get some error like `python was not found or not recognized` try using `python3` or install python if not installed. 

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all necessary packages eg django, channels etc to run our project.

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your environment variables. Example:

```bash
# Generate SECRET_KEY (Recommended)
python generate_secret_key.py
```

```
# filename: .env

ENV_STATUS = "_INFO: Development environment variable loaded successfully!"
SECRET_KEY = "django-insecure-<generate_secret_key.py output>"

EMAIL_HOST_USER = ""
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ""

PG_PASS = ""
```

 - The `ENV_STATUS` will help to debug does this file loaded properly.
 - `SECRET_KEY` Need to `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` data, eg `access_token` **(do not make it public)**.
 - This 2 (`EMAIL_HOST_USER` and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`) variable need to sending `email`.
 - `PG_PASS` Password for PostgreSQL database.


### Run Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

 - `makemigrations` will initialize our migrations. kind a like pack everything up before going to trip.
 - `migrate` will tell the database to changes.


### Create a Superuser (Optional)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Then do the following. (Email, password, reenter password).
You can access the Django built in admin dashboard [**Django Admin**](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)

### Start the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## ðŸ”¥ API Endpoints

```bash
# get available list of urls
python list_urls.py
```

You can test APIs with Postman client. just import `e_commerce.postman_collection.json` in your Postman collection.
