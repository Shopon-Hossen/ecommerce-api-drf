## ðŸš€ Installation & Setup

### Install PostgreSQL if not installed

On `Linux` use APT to install PostgreSQL

```bash
apt install postgresql
```

On `Windows` download PostgreSQL and install it.

### Create PostgreSQL Database

Create a postgresql database with name of `e_commerce`. why `e_commerce`? A: it must be same name as in your `settings.py > DATABASES > default > NAME`

Once you have created the database now you need to install an PostgreSQL extension named `pg_trgm`. why need to install this extension? A: it help us to improve search functionality and performance.

To install `pg_trgm` extension first connect to `e_commerce` database. to do that run this command on `psql`

```bash
\c e_commerce
```

Once connected to the `e_commerce` database install the `pg_trgm` extension by running following command on `psql`

```bash
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shopon-Hossen/ecommerce-api-drf.git e_commerce
cd e_commerce
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your environment variables. Example:

```bash
# Generate SECRET_KEY (Good Practice)
python generate_secret_key.py
```

```
# filename: .env
ENV_STATUS = "INFO: Development environment variable loaded successfully!"
SECRET_KEY = "django-insecure-<generate_secret_key.py output>" # Best Practice

EMAIL_HOST_USER = ""
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ""

PG_PASS = ""
```

### Run Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

```

Then do the following. (Email, password, again_password)
